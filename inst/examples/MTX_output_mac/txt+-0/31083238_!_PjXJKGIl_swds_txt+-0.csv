" Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  Medicine®  OPEN  Methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatinum regimen is still the preferred option for osteosarcoma chemotherapy  A meta-analysis and clinical observation Dapeng Yu, Medical Master Degreea, Shuisheng Zhang, Medical Doctor Degreeb, Alei Feng, Medical Doctor Degreec, Deguo Xu, Medical Master Degreed, Qingshan Zhu, Medical Master Degreee, Yantao Mao, Medical Master Degreef, Yi Zhao, Medical Doctor Degreeg, Yajuan Lv, Medical Master Degreed, Cuiping Han, Medical Master Degreed, Rujun Liu, Medical Master Degreeh, Yuan Tian, Medical Doctor Degreed,  Abstract Background: We designed the study to investigate whether methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatinum (MAP) chemotherapy strategy was still the preferred option for the survival of osteosarcoma patients. Method: We collected some trials of osteosarcoma to make a meta-analysis first.",1,1,13,"1_1"
"The same phenomenon could also be seen in the analysis of clinical data. Conclusion: MAP regimen remains the preferred option for osteosarcoma chemotherapy.

"Although basic research on tumor markers has progressed rapidly in the field of osteosarcoma, treatment methods have changed little in clinical work.[1­5] Surgery, chemotherapy and selective radiotherapy are still the main treatments for patients with osteosarcoma.[6­12] It was reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy including doxorubicin, methotrexate, and cisplatin with intercalated surgery is the standard of care for resectable osteosarcoma patients in those younger than 40 years.[11] The prognosis for osteosarcoma patients presenting with advanced or recurrent disease, or among those older than 40 years are generally poor.",2,6,6,"1_1"
"The combination of surgical removal of the tumor and systemic multidrug chemotherapy mainly consisting of methotrexate, adriamycin, and cisplatin with or without ifosfamide is the standard strategy to treat conventional osteosarcoma.[13] Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy definitely improves disease-free and overall survival (OS) in patients with osteosarcoma,[13] while there was no advantage in event-free survival (EFS) for patients given presurgical chemotherapy.[14] After the failure of first-line treatment, second-line chemotherapy was often given to patients with osteosarcoma who were in good condition.",2,7,7,"1_1"

"Surgery, chemotherapy, and selective radiotherapy are still the main treatments for patients with osteosarcoma.[6­12] The 3-year EFS for high-grade osteosarcoma with multidrug chemotherapy and resection was reported to be 60% to 70%.[22,24,31,32] Chemotherapy combination, named MAP, including cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate, was mainly used for the therapy of osteosarcoma,[31,33­39] while MAP+, used for the treatment of patients with metastatic disease, seemed to improve EFS.[40­42] However, the conclusion was supported in individual clinical trials and was still controversial in many randomized controlled trials.[22,23,24,43] So, we performed this analysis and clinical observation to verify whether MAP and MAP+ have significant differences on the survival of patients. We took the evaluation of survival time of patients with osteosarcoma as the primary evaluation index.",6,133,134,"1_1"
